# Neuroblastoma_Gene_Expression_Analysis
Repository of functions used to analyze publicly-available neuroblastoma gene expression datasets.

So far, I have uploaded functions to analyze the TARGET neuroblastoma gene expression dataset. For more information on the TARGET neuroblastoma initiative, please see: https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/projects/neuroblastoma. The data can be downloaded directly from the cBio Portal at: https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=nbl_target_2018_pub.

All functions for analyzing TARGET data are included in the 'TARGET_Analysis_Functions_v2.ipynb' file. In order to run the functions in this file, you will also need to download the 'neuroblastoma_gene_expression_analysis_files' folder and save it in the same directory as the functions file. For a tutorial on how to use the functions, please see the 'TARGET_Analysis_Tutorial.ipynb' file.

All .ipynb files are meant to be run using Python3 on Jupyter Notebook.
